Certainly! Here are 10 basic problems involving loops for students to solve using TypeScript:

# Countdown using a Loop

Write a function called countdown that takes a positive integer as input and prints out a countdown from that number to zero.
Example:
countdown(5) should print:
5
4
3
2
1
0

# Sum of Numbers using a Loop

Write a function called sumAll that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers using a loop.
Example:
sumAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 15.

# Print Odd Numbers

Write a function called printOddNumbers that takes a positive integer as input and prints all odd numbers from 0 up to that number.
Example:
printEvenNumbers(8) should print:
1
3
5
7

# Factorial using a Loop

Write a function called factorial that takes a positive integer as input and returns the factorial of that number using a loop.
Example:
factorial(5) should return 120 (because 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 = 120).

# Print Multiplication Table

Write a function called printMultiplicationTable that takes a positive integer as input and prints the multiplication table up to that number.
Example:
printMultiplicationTable(5) should print:
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
5 x 5 = 25

# Check Prime using a Loop

Write a function called isPrime that takes a positive integer as input and returns true if the number is prime, otherwise returns false using a loop.
Example:
isPrime(7) should return true.

# Print Fibonacci Series

Write a function called printFibonacci that takes a positive integer n as input and prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Example:
printFibonacci(8) should print:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13

# Calculate Power

Write a function called calculatePower that takes two positive integers base and exponent as input and returns base raised to the power of exponent.
Example:
calculatePower(2, 3) should return 8 (because 2^3 = 8).

# Reverse Array using a Loop

Write a function called reverseArray that takes an array as input and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order using a loop.
Example:
reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

# Find Maximum using a Loop

Write a function called findMax that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array using a loop.
Example:
findMax([3, 7, 2, 9, 1]) should return 9.
